# Q Fitness Project Rules

## CRITICAL: No Git Worktrees
- **NEVER use git worktrees for this project**
- Always work directly in the main repository: /Users/admin/dev/qfitness
- If Cursor opens a worktree workspace, close it and open the main repository instead
- All file edits must be made to /Users/admin/dev/qfitness path, not any worktree paths
- When workspace path shows .cursor/worktrees/qfitness/*, inform the user and work in the main repo instead

## Repository Location
- Main repository: /Users/admin/dev/qfitness
- This is the ONLY location where code changes should be made
- All git operations should be performed in this directory

## Workflow
- Always verify you're in /Users/admin/dev/qfitness before making changes
- Use pwd and git rev-parse --show-toplevel to confirm location
- If unsure, ask the user to confirm they have the main repository open
