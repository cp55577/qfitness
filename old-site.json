Mike and the trainers at Q-Fitness are top-notch! They know I can go further and push harder than I believe, and help me go beyond my perceived limits. Knowing I can do more than I think, and seeing and feeling the gains I've made, has helped me in all areas of my life. I'm so grateful for the personal trainer sessions and try never to miss a class! I can't wait to see how far I'll be in 3 more months."

I can feel all the hard work paying off and I'm reminded that I am a better athlete thanks to Mike and Q Fitness."

When I started working out at Q Fitness I was benching around 55 pounds and am now able to bench 225 pounds. That is almost completely due to Mike's training sessions and ability to motivate his clients."
